# Web Analytics
This is an extension designed to allow users to track the amount of time they spend on different websites. With this extension, users are able to analyze their browsing habits through a simple pi chart and see how much time they spend on different applications, such as email, empowering users to take control of their time and productivity! 

Why: 
I noticed that I seemed to have fewer hours in the day to work than I thought I did after summer started. So, I set out on a mission to understand where my time was going--this was how webAnalytics was born! I created this extension to allow users to understand where they spend most of their time, and possibly learn more about themselves and their productivity habits in the process. 

How: 
- webpack for bundling
- firebase for backend data storage and data collection
- javascript to interpret and display firebase data based on user ID
- javascript also used to trigger the creation of new firebase elements or terminate old ones
- utilized AI such as ChatGPT and Copilot

Feedback: 
Please let me know if you have any feedback or find any bugs; this is only the first release and I've only ever tested it on my computer and don't know how it will hold up to a higher load. Please leave a star if you like the project, and I have included a resources.md file if you are looking for resources to build similar projects using things like firebase or webpack!
